		This shows the how much memory is currently used compared
		with the maximum allowed to the program. Usually the maximum
		is not the same as the actual memory on the computer: java programs
		run within a restricted space. The space available to the program
		can be set at startup with with an extra argument in the
		command line such as 'java -Xmx128M -jar program.jar'. The '-X' part
		tells the java process that it can use up to 128Mb.

	    <info>
		Garbage collection refers to the recovery of memory that
		has been allocated but is no longer needed by the program.
		The memory can then be reused. Garbace collection normally
		happens automatically but runs at a low prority unless the
		program is nearing its maximum allowed memory usage. By running
		it manually you can see how much of the memory usage is
		essential as opposed to uncollected garbage.
