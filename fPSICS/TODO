1) Move reader code and all model type defs to model.f90 module

2) structures for the calculation itself - how to organize gating complexes, 
   channels, states, compartments for best memory access
   
3) populate calc structures and make matrices from model.f90

4) main loop

5) stochastic bits 

6) v diff
