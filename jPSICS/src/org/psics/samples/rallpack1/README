Uniform unbranched cable. The task specification and reference results come
from Upi Bhalla's 1992 Rallpack distribution, part of which is included below.
The rest in the file <a href="README.upi">README.upi</a>.

<p>
The model produces three graphs showing the reference data (correct solution)
in white, and calculated curves in other colors according to the timestep used.
The only difference between the graphs are the axis ranges: they all show the same data.
</p>

<p>
	If the system performs correctly, the results should be almost superimposed with
	less than 0.01 mV difference from the reference, for any of the timesteps.

<i>From Upi Bhalla's 1992 Rallpack package</i>
<pre>This simulation models a simple uniform unbranched cable with
1000 identical compartments, with a length constant of 1, a diameter
of 1 micron, and a total length of 1 mm. The membrane properties are :

RA = 1.0 ohms meter             = 100 ohms cm
RM = 4.0 ohms meter^2           = 40000 ohms cm^2
CM = 0.01 Farads/meter^2        = 1.0 uf/cm^2
EM = -0.065 Volts               = -65 mV
ELEAK = EREST = EM

A current of 0.1 nA is injected in the first compartment. Membrane voltages
are recorded for the first and last compartments.
This model is run for a simulated time of 0.25 seconds.
