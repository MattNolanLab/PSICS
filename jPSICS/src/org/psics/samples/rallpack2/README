<p>
Branched tree with ten levels of branching obeying the Rall 3/2 power
law. This gives a tree with 512 terminal segments and 1023 segments in total.
Electrical properties are as for Rallpack 1. Full details in
 <a href="README.upi">README.upi</a>.

<p>
The model produces three graphs showing the reference data (correct solution)
in white, and calculated curves in other colors according to the timestep used.
The only difference between the graphs are the axis ranges: they all show the same data.
</p>

<p>
	For each timestep (and for the reference) there are two
	curves: the potentail at the root of the tree and the
	potential at a terminal. Note that for this set of cell properties, the two
	potentials are very close throughout the simulation and are
	barely distinguishable in the first figure.

<p>
	If the system performs correctly, the lines should be almost on top
	of each other at these scales (well within 0.01mV).
