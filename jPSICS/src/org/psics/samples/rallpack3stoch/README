Uniform unbranched cable with Hodgkin-Huxley sodium and potassium channels showing 
a prpoagating action potential. The task specification and reference results come 
from Upi Bhalla's 1992 Rallpack distribution, part of which is included below. 
The rest in the file <a href="README.upi">README.upi</a>.

<p>
The model produces three graphs showing the reference data computed by Neuron (green) and Genesis (orange)
and calculated curves in other colors according to the timestep used:
magenta : 1ms, cyan : 20us, blue : 1us. The only difference between the graphs are 
the axis ranges: they all show the same data. The reference data was computed with 
1us timesteps.
</p>

<p>
	If the system performs correctly, the blue line (1us timestep) and 
	reference green and orange should be almost coincident at the beginning and 
	differ by less than 0.2ms after 250ms.
</p>
 
 <p>
 	The magenta and cyan lines show how increasing the timestep makes very little change 
 	to the spike shape, but changes the period slightly such that by the end of the 
 	calculation the longer timestep calculation has spikes a few milliseconds behind. This 
 	is a normal feature of the implicit euler method arising from the use of forward differencing
 	for the time derivative.
