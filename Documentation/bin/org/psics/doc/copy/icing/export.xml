	<h1>Exporting 3D models</h1>


	<par>
		Models can be exported in <a href="http://www.web3d.org/about/overview/">X3D</a> format,
		the ISO ratified successor to VRML from <a href="http://www.web3d.org/">web3d.org</a>.

		The export function is under the "file" menu of the main window and does not require
		any Java3D support, so can be used as an alternative to the internal Icing 3d viewer.
		Once exported, models can be viewed with a range of standard 3d viewers, embedded in
		web pages, and used to generate high-resolution visualizations.

		Only the currently selected channel populations are exported so the morphology file
		should correspond exactly to what is displayed by Icing. Depending on the size of
		the model, the export process can generate very large files. These may take some time
		to write and will cause the interface to freeze in the meantime.
	</par>

		At present, only the most basic form of X3D export is supported, but there are
		several possible improvements and extensions. If you have cause to use this feature and
		need more control over what is exported or how the process relates to the rest of
		Icing, please get in touch.
