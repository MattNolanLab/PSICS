    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <par>
      	PSICS comes with a range of built-in models. They can be run with the command-line argument "-e"
      	followed by the name of the model to run. Some of the examples are also part of standard test cases
      	that are run with specific options such as "-v" to run the rallpack validation examples.
     </par>

     <par>
      	For each model there is a single page summary that is generated automatically
        when the model is run.
