	<h1>Cell Environment</h1>


	<p>
		The <x>CellEnvironment</x> object sets the external temperature of the cell and defines the ions that
		are to be included in the simulation. Each ion has an id that is used by other components that need to refer
		 to it. This block should contain all the ions that are referenced from other model components. At present,
		 a reversal potential is directly associated with each ion. Future versions may implement the more
		 realistic alternative of specifying internal and external solutions from which the reversal potential can
		 be derived.
