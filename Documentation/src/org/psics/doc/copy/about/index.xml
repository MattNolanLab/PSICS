	 <h1>Design and development</h1>

	 <par>
		PSICS is open source, covered by the GNU GPL license.  It is developed by
		<a href="http://www.textensor.com/">Textensor Ltd</a> under contract to
		<a href="http://www.cnr.ed.ac.uk/links/MNolan.htm">Dr Matt Nolan</a> at
	 	<a href="http://www.cnr.ed.ac.uk/">The Centre for Neuroscience Research</a> at the
	 	University of Edinburgh, UK with grant funding from the
	 	<a href="http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/">BBSRC</a>. The partnership between experienced
	 	scientific software developers working within a commercial environment,
	 	and researches with immediate modeling needs is an efficient and cost effective way
	 	to develop and maintain the increasingly sophisticated tools needed for research.

		The <a href="architecture.html">system architecture</a> merges certain aspects of
		modern simulator trends (declarative models, object oriented internal representations) with
		more traditional approaches to high performance scientific computing such as up-front
		memory management and the use of languages developed specifically for array based mathematical
		calculations.
	 </par>

	<par>
		The <a href="log.html">develpment log</a> is periodically updated and
		summarizes major changes and releases.

	<par>
		PSICS has been extensively tested and validated. The <a href="rallpack.html">RallPack</a> tests
		are included in the standared distribution. Validation of the stochastic calculatoins is
		presented in the accompanying publication (in preparation).

		The best way to get familiar with PSICS is to look through the
		<a href="../guide/index.html">user guide</a> in conjunction with some of the
		<a href="../examples.html">examples</a>. The
		<a href="../formats/index.html">input files reference</a> presents the details of
		specifying models. PSICS itself is a command line program, but the standalone tool
		ICING provides a graphical interface for visualizing and labelling cells and to
		help set up channel populations.

	<par>
		There is a brief presentation covering the main features: <a href="psics.odp">Open Office</a> | <a href="psics.pdf">PDF</a>.
	</par>
	
	<par>
		One direction for future development is to include support for user-defined types. To this end there is a 
		proof of concept XML format and interpreter for 
		<a href="http://www.psics.org/lems/">"Low Entropy Model Specification"</a>.

	<h3>Implementation</h3>

	<par>
		The bulk of PSICS is written in Java. The core calculations are available in both Java and Fortran 95. The
		Fortran version is compiled to a platform dependent native library or to a standalone executable that
		is called from Java. The connection
		between the two is via a single-file plain text specification of the discretized model.
		Once such a model specification has been created the core calculation can be run independently of
		the Java virtual machine. This is intended for use on multi-processor machines where different instances
		of the same calculation can be run on separate processors with minimal overheads.
