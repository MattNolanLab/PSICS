<h1>Interaction between PSICS and NeuroML</h1>

<par>
	Significant development effort has been devoted towards making PSICS compatible,
	as far as possible, with other systems. In particular, this involves
	supporting emerging standards such as ChannelML and MorphML, and more generally
	XML data formats under the <a href="http://neuroml.sourceforge.net/">NeuroML</a> banner.

	The approach has not, however, been to take the NeuroML specifications as defining
	the model space and to write
	a simulator for them. Instead, the PSICS input specifications were developed
	independently of existing specifications or simulators and are driven purely by
	the need to express what the modeler who uses PSICS needs.

	This therefore presents a useful test case for the expressiveness
	and ease-of-use of NeuroML. This document details our experiences of
	working with NeuroML and makes a number of suggestions of ways the standard
	could be further developed to improve its usefulness as a model storage and
	trasfer format for projects such as PSICS.

	An earlier version of this document contained an extensive commentary on the 
	general structure of NeuroML and links to separate documents about MorphML, ChannelML,
	NeuroML Biophysics and NeuroML exporting.  However, as of the March 2009 NeuroML standards 
	meeting, many of these comments and concerns have been taken on board by the NeuroML developers and 
	work is under way to address them. 
	These pages are therefore no longer pertinent and have been removed.
