	<h1>Getting started</h1>

	<par>
		PSICS runs on Linux, MacOSX and Windows. It requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), version 1.5 or
		later.
	</par>


	<summary>
	  	<b>For those familiar with java/unix</b>: PSICS is distributed
	  	as an executable jar file and the model to run should be supplied as an argument.
	  	The output goes to a new folder with an index file summarizing the results.
	  	With "-st" and no model file it runs an internal test case.
	</summary>



	<h2>Installation</h2>

	<par>
		If necessary, install the Java Runtime Environment. This is available free
		from <a href="http://www.java.com/">www.java.com</a>.
		To check the installed JRE it can be run with the <cmd>-version</cmd> argument from a unix shell or
		command prompt:<br/>
		<cmd>java -version</cmd><br/>
		This should produce something like:
	</par>
			<out><pre>java version "1.5.0_10"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_10-b03)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_10-b03, mixed mode, sharing)</pre></out>
	<par>
		Versions beginning "1.5" and "1.6" are fine: PSICS will not work with 1.4 or earlier. If you have multiple
		versions of the JRE installed it may be necessary to specify the full path to the java executable. Under unix
		the path being used can be found by typing "which java". Depending where it is installed, the path to other
		JRE's could be something like  <cmd>/usr/local/jdk1.6.0/bin/java</cmd>
	</par>

	<par>
		PSICS itself comes as a single executable jar file with a name like "psics-0.3.0.jar" where the numbers
		indicate the version. Once you have downloaded
		the file, no further installation is required, although it
		can be convenient to move it to a memorable folder such as "psics" or "jars".
	</par>


	<h2>Running PSICS</h2>

	<par>
		Assuming the jar file is in the current directory, the command <br/><cmd>java -jar psics-xxxx.jar</cmd><br/>
		(where "xxx" is replaced by the actual version) should run PSICS.
		No command line arguments have been specified so it will print out the usage message and exit.
	</par>

	<par>
		The command:<br/>
		<cmd>java -jar psics-xxx.jar -st</cmd><br/>
		should run one of the built-in models. It will create a folder for the results under the current working
		directory called <tt>wcspikes</tt> and will will add a file called <tt>index.html</tt> summarizing the results of the
		calculation.  It will also save the model specification that was used in the <tt>wcspikes</tt>
		folder.
	</par>

	<par>
		If there is a model specification in the current directory with a main file called <tt>run1.xml</tt> then the command<br/>
		 <cmd>java -Xmx1g -jar psics-xxx.jar run1.xml</cmd><br/>
		 will run that model. The results will go in a new folder called <tt>run1</tt>.
	</par>
	<par>
		The flag "Xmx1g" is optional. By default, java restricts its memory usage to a number normally much 
		lower than what is available on the machine. This can be a problem for large models and lead to an
		out of memory error.  This form of the flag tells the Java virtual machine to use up to 1GB of memory. 
		You can also use "m" for MB as in "Xmx512m". 
	</par>


	<par>
		If the jar file is not in the current directory then the full path to the file will be required.
		Unix users may find it convenient to set up an alias in the .bashrc file (or equivalent). For example, if
		the 1.5 JRE is installed in /usr/local/jdk5/ and the psics jar file is  <tt>/usr/local/psics/psics-0.3.0.jar</tt>
		then the line<br/>
		<cmd>alias psics="/usr/local/jdk5/bin/java -jar /usr/local/psics/psics-0.3.0.jar"</cmd><br/>
		added to the .bashrc file will enable PSICS to be run by simply typing<br/>
		<cmd>psics</cmd>
	</par>

	<par>
		On Macs, the default location for Java is under /System/Library so the line for the .bashrc file could be
		something like:<br/>
		<cmd>alias psics="/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.5/Commands/java -jar /Users/xyz/PSICS/psics-0.7.0.jar"</cmd>
	</par>



	<h2>Command line options</h2>

	<par>
		A full list of options is available by running PSICS with the <cmd>-help</cmd> argument.
	</par>
	<par>
		When running PSICS
		on a file the control parameters are set within the file rather than being supplied on the
		command line so no additional arguments are required.
	</par>
	<par>
		Command line arguments provide access to some of the peripheral functionality such as running internal
		tests or constructing text summaries of output data. In particular:<br/>
			<table cellspacing="8" align="center" width="80%;">
				<tr><td valign="top"><cmd>-st</cmd></td><td>tells PSICS to run the internal short test. This can be useful for checking an
			installation: no other arguments are required. Other similar options are <cmd>-lt</cmd> for a longer
			series of tests and <cmd>-v</cmd> for the rallpack validation models.</td></tr>
			<tr><td valign="top"><cmd>-i</cmd></td><td>rebuilds an index page listing the models that have been run in the current directory. The
			page can be viewed from a web browser and provides a convenient way to access a set of models and
			their results.</td></tr>
		</table>
	</par>
