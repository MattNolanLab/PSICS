<h1>ICING - Interactive Channel INsertion Gui</h1>

	<par>
		Once the channel models and the morphology are available, the bulk of the work in
		specifying a complex neuron model is to relate the two together by specifying how the channels are
		distributed over the structure. This is the puropse of ICING. It allows the creation and editing of
		<a href="../formats/properties.html">cell properties files</a>, and the positioning of labels on
		the structure corresponding to references from such files.

	<h2>Download and installation</h2>
	<par>
		ICING is written in Java and runs on Window, MacOSX and Linux. It includes optional
		3D visualization features that require some further work to get Java3D installed and to set the
		available memory. It can be downloaded from the main <a href="../download.html">download area</a>
		which also includes links and installation instructions for Java3D.
