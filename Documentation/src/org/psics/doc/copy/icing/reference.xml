	<h1>Specifying channel distributions</h1>

	<par>
		The ICING user interface provides an alternative method for specifying channel distributions
		instead of writing the xml by hand. The two methods allow the same set of models to be expressed
		but ICING does not directly match the layout of the <a href="../formats/properties.html">ChannelPopulation</a>
		block and its children. Instead, it intended to be accessible with minimal reference to the
		formats documentation. Specifications created with ICING are, however, stored in exactly the same format
		as those created by hand. Hand-edited models can be opened in ICING and vice versa without any
		difficulty.

		The  image shows the channel distribution panel. The left column is for selecting the population
		to edit. The checkboxes to the left set whether it should be shown in the morphology display. The center
		specifies how the local density is calculated and the right column sets the region on the cell over
		which the density applies.
	</par>

	<h2>Density specification</h2>
	<par>
		The simplest way to set the density is with a constant value in the <x>Chanel density</x> field
		(in channels per square micron) and all the checkboxes unselected. For variable densities,
		this field can contain an expression in terms of the path length, <m>p</m>, local radius <m>r</m>,
		diameter, <m>d</m> and branch order <m>b</m>. The expression uses standard programming style rather
		than mathematical notation in that "*" signs are required for multiplication (whereas they are
		normally implicit in mathematical notation) and functions are written out as abbreviated words:
		exp, log, abs, sin, cos, tan, log10.
	</par>
	<par>
		Possible density expessinos include <br/> <m>10</m> <br/> <m>10 * exp (-0.01 * p)</m> <br/>
		<m>5. / (p + 10)  + 2</m> <br/> <m>4 * r * r</m>
	</par>

	<par>
		After specifying the density per unit area, there is still some freedom in how this is interpreted
		when positioning channels. There are two supported options provided by the <x>Distribution</x> drop-down.
		If set to <x>Regular</x> then channels are placed at uniform intervals along each process. If set to
		<x>Poisson</x> then the density is interpreted as a probability of finding a channel in the next small increment
		along the dendrite. In either case, the angle around the process is sampled from a uniform distribution.
		The seed for random channel allocations is stored as part of the specification so that the positions
		used in the calculation are exactly those shown in ICING. The <x>Reseed</x> button resets the seed allowing
		a new set of positions to be generated.
	</par>

	<par>
		The density set by the expression can be modified in two ways. The <x>Cap density</x> field sets an upper
		limit, and the <x>Fix total</x> option rescales the applied density to give the desired total number of
		channels on the cell. Capping the density can be useful to avoid unwanted behavior of expressions outside
		the region they are intended for - at the origin for a 1/p rule, for example, or in remote parts of the
		structure with a rule such as "increase linearly away from the soma  up to 50 channels per um2".
	</par>

	<h3>Relative densities</h3>

	<par>
		A central aim of the PSICS xml formats is to minimize redundancy or duplication in the specifications.
		To this end, if several channel populations have the same distribution profile up to a scaling factor, then
		the distribution rule can be specified once and then each population can make reference to the
		single instance of the rule. For exploratory modelling this is normally what is required instead of
		having multiple instances of the parameters that all need changing together. For example, where certain
		groups of channels act together (like sodium and potassium channels in the HH model) the
		the behavior is typically much more sensitive to changes in just one of the populations than to
		scaling then both up or down together.
	</par>

	<par>
		ICING gives the same effect via relative densities. This uses a canonical channel population to set the
		density expression and then lets other populations set their densities a a fixed factor times the
		density of the first population. It is achieved by selecting the <x>Relative</x> checkbox for the channel density
		and then setting the scaling factor and target channel population.
	</par>


	<h2>Region constraints</h2>

	<par>
		The region over which a distribution is applied is taken, by default, to be the whole cell. This can be
		changed by adding one or more region constraints. These take the form of stylized sentences specifying an
		operation (<x>include</x>, <x>exclude</x>, or <x>restrict to</x>) and a region. The region is either relative to
		labelled points on the structure or, in the case of the <x>where</x> option, it is set by a boolean expression
		evaluated over the cell.
	</par>


	<par>
		The applicable region is computed by applying the constraints in order. The <x>include</x> operation causes
		any points matching the current condition to be added to those already selected. The <x>exclude</x> operation
		removes any matching points from the active set, and the <x>restrict to</x> operation leaves only those points
		that are both in the active set and match the current condition.
	</par>

	<par>
		For label-dependent regions, the labels should be positioned on the appropriate structure. The labels
		available in the user interface are taken from the active morphology. To target specific sections of
		dendrite two conditions can be used. For example a first condition "include points proximal to label2" with
		a second one "restrict to points distal to label1" gives just the section between label1 and label2
		on the structure.
	</par>

	<par>
		The quantities available for expressions to use with the "where" condition are the same as for the
		density expression, except that here the expression must be boolean (true/false) valued rather than
		real-valued for the density. Examples of such expressions include:
	</par>
	<par>
		<table align="center" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
			<tr>
			<td><m>p &lt; 1000</m></td>
			<td style="width : 20px;"> </td>
			<td>   points less than 100 um from the soma</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
		<td><m>(r > 2) &amp;&amp; (p &lt; 20)</m></td><td></td><td>wide dendrites more
		than 20um from the soma</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><m> (p % 100) &lt; 1</m></td><td></td><td>1um long sections every 100 microns.</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
	</par>


	<par>
		This combination of density expressions, region constraints, capping, labels and fixed totals
		 should enable most distributions of interest to be expressed relatively concisely. If necessary,
		 several population definitions can refer to the same channel type in order to build up a complex density
		 profile as a number of separate pieces.
