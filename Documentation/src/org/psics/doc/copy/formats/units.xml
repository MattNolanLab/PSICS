	<h1>Units</h1>

		Floating point quantities in input files should normally include the units in which they are expressed
		using one or a combination of the symbols below. Units can be combined by separating them by a spaces
		(for products) or "/" for division.

		The symbols follow SI conventions as far as possible, but are restricted to the normal character set
		(no superscripts etc) so, for example, m2 stands for m<sup>2</sup> and per_m2 for
		m<sup>-2</sup>.

		Units with a factor of 10<sup>-6</sup> normally written with the greek letter &#956; (mu), are written
		with a normal latin "u" instead, so "um" stands for micrometer, and "uA" for microAmpere.
		Other prefixes are as normal: (<b>p</b>, 10<sup>-12</sup>;
				     <b>n</b>, 10<sup>-9</sup>;
		 		     <b>u</b>, 10<sup>-6</sup>;
		             <b>m</b>, 10<sup>-3</sup>;
		             <b>c</b>, 10<sup>-2</sup>;
		             <b>K</b>, 10<sup>3</sup>;
		             <b>M</b>, 10<sup>6</sup>;
		             <b>G</b>, 10<sup>9</sup>)
		although certain intermediate ones (d for deci, h for hecto etc) will not be understood.

		Several of the entries in the table are compound units for which there isn't a single name, such as
		per_s_per_mol used in expressing a reaction rate. These are included because they are used internally
		as single entities. For expressing parameters they may be used interchangeably with compound forms.
		For example, a concentration-dependent transition rate could be expressed as "50 per_s_per_mol" or
		"50 /s/mol" or 50 per_s/mol" or indeed "50 per_s per_mol" (with a space in the middle, unlike the first
		option).
