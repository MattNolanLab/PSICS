	<h1>Visualizaiton and Output</h1>

	<par>
		The core calculation produces output files consisting of tabular data where the first
		column is the time and subsequent columns are the values of whtever recorders are
		configured in the model. For a simple model there is just one output data set. For
		parameter sweeps (RunSet) there is one for each paramter value. Each data set is
		stored in two formats: a compact binary form with the .dat extension, and a space delimited
		text form with the .txt extension.

		After the core calculation has finished, the results are summarized on an HTML page. The
		ViewConfig object exists to add plots to that page by defining some default views of the data.
		The normal usage is to embed a ViewConfig block within the main model file containing one or
		more plot definition. Currently the available plots are: LineGraph,
		MeanVariance and PowerSpectrum as
		described below. All three plot definitions have the same structure. The LineGraph just
		produces plots of the columns of the specified output file against time. The other plot types
		perform some processing on the data first and plot the derived data on appropriate axes. The
		MeanVariance plot is a special case for performing mean-variance analysis and is only
		useful if the data it is given are currents from a single compartment with a single
		type of stochastic ion channel.

		The contents of a LineGraph block are optional axis definitions, one or more Line or LineSet
		definitions, and one or more View definitions. The Line and LineSet blocks work the
		same way to specify the file that the data comes from, and optionally the line width, color etc.
		The View blocks each define a single plot of the data, specifying the axis ranges for the
		view window.

		The data that is plotted does not have to come from the results of the PSICS calculation.
		Other data filed can be included in the folder and plotted the same way, as long as they
		conform to plain ascii table structure. For the case where different units were used for
		external files, the data can be rescaled by setting the <x>rescale</x> parameterin a LineSet
		definition.
	</par>

	<par>
		One last convenience element in a LineGraph definition is the DataComparison block.
		This also referes to a reference file, but instead of generating a plot, the mean
		mean and variance of the difference between the plotted data and the comparison data
		will be computed and added to the html output file.
