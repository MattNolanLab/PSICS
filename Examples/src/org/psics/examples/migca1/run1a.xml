<About>
		Model corresponding to figure 1a with a steady current injection at the soma
		and recording from two points on the apical dendrite, 200um and 400um from the soma.
		It shows some backpropagation to 200um but very little at 400um.
	</About>

	<About>
		N.B. the cell looks odd because it is the exported compartmentalization from Neuron
		that has lost the original positions. There are just straight segments and a
		systematic branching angle that makes it curl up.

	<About>
		 This uses the coded channel transition rate option in several of the channels in order
		 to use exactly the same expressions as in the Migliore paper. The leaks are stochastic
		 with open probability 0.7 and conductance 20pS.
