	<info>Migliore et al CA1 pyramidal cell</info>

<About>
		Model corresponding to figure 1a with a steady current injection at the soma
		and recording from two points on the apical dendrite, 200um and 400um from the soma.
		It shows some backpropagation to 200um but very little at 400um.
	</About>

	<About>
		This is not an exact reimplementation of the Migliore et al model but rather a nearby
		equivalent in PSICS using only the standard channel transition equation.
	    Slow inactivation of the sodium channel
	    has not been modelled as an independent gate that only partially closes
		(closing to 20% in the soma and to 50% in the dendrites) since the kinetics of this process do
		not appear to affect the model. Instead, the inactivated dendritic channels are simply left
		out of the model by providing two populations: one population, at 50% of maximum,
		that covers all active compartments and another, overlapping population, just for the soma.
