  Voltage clamp with stochastic channels. This uses a nested
  CommandSet within the RunSet to vary two parameters for the model. 
The run set changes the density of channels in the model (either 2 or
  8 per square micron). For each model, the command set changes the
  potential of the step by modifing the "to" attribute of the step
  block.

 The cell is just a sphere, and the channel is the HH sodium channel 
from rallpack3.
