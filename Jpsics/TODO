two probs:

1) discretization dependence in the CA1-pyramidal model from Padraig
2um, 1.5um give different spikes by a frew ms.

2) not same as neuron


could be neuron discretization with channels on initial segment being joined
 to soma instead. - is initial seg conical??

Need to discretize like neuron: cuts at branch points and where minor branch 
joins major. Carry through labels accordingly.
 
segment discretizer is same as before. Difference is in compartmentizer - 
does almost nothing :)  Each pair of points gives a cpt
worry about labels, channels, adding point where minor branch 
emerges from parent. What else?

 - 1 day???
